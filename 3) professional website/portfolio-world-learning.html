                    I created this website as a game to help people learn geography.<br><br>
                    
                    The game is divided into 6 continents (following the 7-continent model, excluding Antarctica).<br>
                    This division is visible on the homepage and under the "Continents" section in the navigation bar.<br><br>
                    
                    By clicking on each continent, users can access the corresponding games page.<br>
                    Each continent features 4 games: "Guess the capital from the country," "Guess the country from the capital," "Guess the country from the flag," and "Guess the country from the map."<br><br>
                    
                    Additionally, Europe and North America include two extra games: respectively, "European Union: true or false?" and a similar quiz for North America.<br><br>
                    
                    By clicking on a game title, users are taken to the actual gameplay page, where they can start the game by pressing the Start button.<br>
                    Each game requires the player to type the correct answer based on the given prompt. For instance, in the "Guess the country from the flag" game, a random flag from the selected continent will be displayed, and the player must enter the corresponding country name.<br><br>
                    
                    After submitting an answer and clicking the Check button, the correct answer is shown along with a message indicating whether the playerâ€™s input was correct or not.<br><br>
                    
                    At the end of a game session, final statistics are displayed: total score, number of correct answers, percentage of correct responses, and a motivational phrase that changes depending on the score achieved.<br><br>
                    
                    The game is available in 3 languages: Italian, English, and Finnish.<br><br>
                    
                    There is also a "Study" section featuring cards for each country, including the country's name, capital, map, and flag.<br><br>
                    
                    No database is connected to this website, as the goal was to keep it simple, accessible to everyone, and free of data tracking.<br><br>
